## Simulation-Based Process Optimization in Edible Oil Refining

This project presents a Python-based simulation model designed to optimize the edible oil refining process. It predicts key processing metrics such as NaOH dosage, final Free Fatty Acid (FFA) levels, and refining loss based on input oil quality and type.

### Key Features

- Models refining behavior for mustard, soybean, sunflower, and groundnut oils
- Uses BIS/FSSAI standards and empirical formulas for accuracy
- Calculates real-time adjustments in chemical dosing
- Supports pre-process QA/QC decision-making
- Includes numerical modeling, error analysis, and industrial case study

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Numerical Simulation
- Oil Technology (Fats & Oils Processing)
